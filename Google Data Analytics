# ASK
## Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments.
## One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships.
## Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders.
## Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
## Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders.
## Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, the belief is that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth.
## The goal behind this analysis is to find out how do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently
